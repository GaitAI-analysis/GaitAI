// contradicted) the canonical sources in products.ts and publications.ts, and

// parallel; products, capabilities, signals, domains and outcomes now come
// from products.ts / gaitscape/graph.ts via src/data/taxonomy.ts, and the
// workflow comes from `workflowStages` in products.ts.

 * The four CTA families the whole site draws from.
 *
 * Every conversion surface belongs to exactly one of these, so a visitor meets
 * four consistent asks instead of eight near-synonyms — "Book a demo", "Talk
 * to us", "Pilot with us", "Start a conversation", "Get in touch", "Discuss a
 * study" were all in use at once. Labels live here so they cannot drift apart
 * again, and each call site imports the family that matches its job:
 *
 *   demo      commercial interest — product, vertical and insight surfaces
 *   pilot     deployment interest — products, use cases, the deploy flow
 *   research  research or clinical collaboration — research, publications
 *   investor  investment interest — the investors route only
 *
 * The contact form exists in exactly one place, the home CTA section
 * (`id="contact"`), which is why every default target is the absolute
 * `/#contact` and not a page-relative `#contact` that resolves to nothing
 * on any other route.
